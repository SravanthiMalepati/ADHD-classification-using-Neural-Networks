# ADHD-classification-using-Neural-Networks
Identifying the classification significance of rs-fMRI Data to build Neural Network Models (LSTM) using python libraries like niLearn, NumPy, and Keras.
Reshaped the data using the mask to extract useful features.
Studied the benefits and drawbacks of Neural Networks [RNN, GRU] especially LSTM for classifying ADHD rs-fMRI data.
